Welcome to mutwo's documentation!
=================================

**Mutwo** is a flexible, event based framework for composing music or other time-based arts in Python. It aims to help composers to build musical structures in a meaningful way and translate those structures to different third party objects (e.g. midi files, `csound <http://www.csounds.com/>`_ scores, musical notation with `Lilypond <lilypond.org/>`_ via `Abjad <https://github.com/Abjad/abjad>`_). The general design philosophy stresses out the independence and freedom of the user with the help of generic data structures and an easily extensible and tweakable software design.

The following example generates a short midi file:

.. code-block:: python

    from mutwo.events import basic, music
    from mutwo.parameters import pitches
    from mutwo.converters import frontends
    simple_melody = basic.SequentialEvent(
        [
            music.NoteLike(pitches.WesternPitch(pitch_name), duration=0.5, volume=0.75)
            for pitch_name in ("c", "a", "g", "e")
        ]
    )
    midi_file_converter = frontends.midi.MidiFileConverter()
    midi_file_converter.convert(simple_melody, 'my_simple_melody.mid')
